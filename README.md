Just got out of the theater and I swear, I'm still floating, or maybe it’s the sugar high from too much soda. The movie, When Life Gives You Tangerines, was like this, like, odd mix of flavors. Or colors. Both, I guess? My back is killing me from those old seats, and there are popcorn crumbs stuck to my jeans, which is kinda annoying but whatever. Anyway, the film — wow. It was like biting into a tangerine that suddenly tastes like a pineapple? So unexpected.

There was this scene where the main character — let’s call him, uh, Jake cause I don’t remember his name — he was standing in an orange orchard, but his mind was on a beach. Or maybe that was me, thinking of the beach. The waves sounded like the soundtrack. So chill. I should so download the movie, just to relive that part. His thoughts were all like, 'life’s giving me citrus, so I’m making... juice?'. Nah, wait... that’s wrong. Anyway, it was poetic in a muddled way.

> The music! Oh my god, it was everywhere and nowhere. Some song about missing socks and lost loves played during a breakup scene, which made no sense but all the sense, ya know? Loud chewing and people shuffling like a bad SoundCloud track remixing with the film’s score. Now the theater smell is hangin’ onto me and I can’t shake it off.

There was this grandma character, who I think morphed into a wise owl at some point? She was spewing out wisdom like it was candy, but then there’s this owl hootin’, making everyone question reality. I leaned over to this random dude, both blurting out watch the movie later cause we were equally confused by that. Or amused? Amusedly confused maybe.

Someone once told me, or did I read it? Never bring logic to a movie about tangerines. Cause logic slipped into a rabbit hole back there. And now I’m out here, trying to text, but honestly, more like typing word salad. Jurassic-era WiFi here makes sending this a twilight odyssey.
